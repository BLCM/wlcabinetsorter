# Better Loot for Wonderlands

Instead of having a big monolithic "Better Loot" for Wonderlands, like for
BL2+TPS+BL3, Apocalyptech decided to split it up into smaller components,
so it's easier for players to pick and choose what parts to have active.
This was done mainly because the Loot Luck mechanic on Wonderlands is pretty
great on its own, and I figured that folks may want to keep that functionality,
while still enjoying the rest of what Better Loot would do.

So, in the end, there's four mods which, taken together, basically all add
up to what a "WL Better Loot" mod would've been.  If you want the full Better
Loot experience, just add in all four of these and you should be good to go.
You're free to pick and choose, though, and just use the ones that you want!

1. [[Guaranteed Boss Drops]] - Like the title suggests, this one makes boss
   drops guaranteed, and makes them mostly drop as many items as are in their
   dedicated pools.
2. [[Guaranteed Enchantments]] - Like the title suggests, ensures that all
   enchantable gear will spawn with enchantments in the game.
3. [[Enchantment-Spawning Tweaks]] - Various tweaks to how enchantments spawn.
   See the mod page for more details!
4. [[No Loot Luck: Better Loot Edition]] - This mod completely removes the
   Loot Luck mechanic -- drop weights will be the same all the way throughout
   the game, and even in Chaos levels.  This is what sets Better Loot-style
   drop weights across the game, but it does come at the expense of not having
   the admittedly-fun Loot Luck mechanic.

So that's it!  Use all four of those mods for the "full" Better Loot experience,
or pick and choose to suit your desired playstyle.  Enjoy!
